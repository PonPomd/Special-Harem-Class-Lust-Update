# Special-Harem-Class-Lust-Update
“Enrol in the class of your dreams—where the teacher’s naughty, the classmates are beautiful, and every choice leads closer to intimacy.”

You’ve just missed out on getting into college—but you stumble across a strange pre-college programme that promises one thing: all the classmates are beautiful girls, and the teacher is… unusually forward.
In Special Harem Class, you play as the lone male student in this unconventional class. Guided by your perverted teacher, you explore the city, meet and date classmates, build relationships, and unlock intimate (18+) scenes as you navigate school life and romance in this adult-oriented sandbox visual novel. 

The game features dozens of characters—27 girls in total, including 9 main romance routes, along with side and extra characters for more flexible interactions.
